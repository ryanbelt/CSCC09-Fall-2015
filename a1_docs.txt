	The notification bar we have in “Browes Movies” page and “Add Movie” page take a space under and rest of content. It will leave empty if the bar is not called. Then it looks weird to have an empty space under the header bar. 
	However, we can fix it by jumping content up when it is not displaying which will make the page have a bad user feeling.
	We asked Prof. Allen about this question during tutorial, and he replied that since the handout didn't have any specification about that, we can leave it
